### Caching

In order to increase page loading speed for PicoFotofolder, an additional subfolder `/thumbnails` for thumbnails is automatically created in your image folder. Therefore, make sure that write rights are granted for your image folder. A hidden file ".fotofolder.dat" is also created. This file stores meta information of your images. The subfolder `/thumbnails` as well as the file" .fotofolder.dat "are created automatically and can be deleted at any time if incorrect information is displayed in the gallery.

Make sure the GD Library pgp-gd library is installed on your webserver.
